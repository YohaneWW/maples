# _Maples_

_Inevitable swaying,_

<br>

_accompany with maples._

<br>

_The time flees_

<br>

_and the avenue was fading,_

<br>

_the splendid pier in dusk and everything is vain..._

<br>

_Breaking away from shore and being unrest,_

<br>

_it's just loaf by harbor..._

# 楓葉

飘摇不可避

<br>

尚有枫叶相伴之

<br>

岁月光阴缥缈

<br>

道路渐行渐远

<br>

黄昏中码头依然伫立

<br>

殊不知往事已然成空…

<br>

只敢在港口徘徊

<br>

眼下，随着追忆与懊悔

<br>

终将自这片海湾离去…
